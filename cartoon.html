<h1 style="color: orange"> What is a cartoon show? </h1>
<p> A cartoon show is drawings being bought to life via animation. This can be done either digitally via computer programs, effects and the use of voice actors. Another way cartoons can be made are by physical hard copy prints of cartoons such as comic strips.
Nowadays people watch cartoon shows than read books about them like Horrid Henry, Dennis the Menace and superhero stuff too. Cartoon shows as well as being a source of entertainment by giving a good laugh and time pass, it also plays an important role in how you're children interact with others around them by showing real life situations they could get into and how to resolve them.
</p>

<h2 style="color: red"> Why you should watch cartoon shows? </h2>
<p> Even though a lot of people say that cartoon shows are for kids, which is a theory cultivated from people's thoughts because they're aimed at children aged between their early stages and 11/12, but when you think about it, it's aimed at everyone because there are parts of it such as the idiot of the group doing something stupid which can make people of all ages laugh.
  An example is the little brother from the show Horrid Henry always getting the older brother in trouble, but then one day ends up getting himself in trouble by trying to get his older brother in trouble, and I would say people of all ages would find this funny because he tries doing what his older brother does, but can't do it as he's not the same and ends up getting in trouble anyway because he messed up.
More importantly, for children esspecially, cartoon shows are a form of entertainment for them on learning how to behave and how to intereact with others nicely and by watching cartoon shows, they can make new friends due to them watching the same show(s) and having the same favourite character.
There are also cartoon shows/ adaptations for adults as well, a well known show called Mr Bean which was at first aimed towards adults because of the events occuring in the show, but not too explicit, however later on it got adapted into a cartoon show which was for children, but previous fans of the show, being the parents of the child might've joined in to watch an episode or two because it gives them nostalgia from their childhood.</p>

<p> A funny thing about cartoon shows can also be the sound effects used such as a fight. Below is an audio of an example of what a cartoon punch sound effect is like. </p>

<p> Below is a video of the cartoonised version of Mr Bean. Honestly there's no difference as it's the same actor but it's just that his voice is being used instead of him phsyically acting it out, but the cartoon version does what he did in his own show, so it doesn't make a difference but enjoy the video.</p>
